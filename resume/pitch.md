I've been working with data analysis for over 6 years, but exclusively in the financial industry. Two and a half years ago, as a response to the growing economic crisis in Brazil, I had to apply advanced statistics and machine learning models using Python to keep the profits up.

To my surprise, after a while working more as a data scientist than an investment manager, I fell in love with this profession. I no longer wanted to trade stocks and build investment portfolios, but to create and test different models and techniques. 

After years of study and preparation, I am ready to pursue a career in this field.

I would be an amazing fit for your company because I not just have all the necessary skills to do the job, I also bring the different perspective of someone with experience being the consumer of data analysis and products to the team!

Thank you in advance for you time and attention. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
